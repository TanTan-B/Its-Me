            <h6>Hey, I'm TanTan B</h6>
            <p>I am on a journey to figure out more about myself. For now, I know I love writing, coding, sports, and a satisfying aesthetic website. <br>
            I do not meet the requirements of what I would like to see in a website, but I will someday. For now, I'll just continue learning(: 
            <br>... <br>
            Writing is something that truly inspires me and helps me gain new perspectives about life. <br> 
             Whether it's writing in general or writing a beautiful line of code.</p>
